# Biological-signal-processing

The project mainly consists of three stages in which the first stage is the pre-processing of the MRI data 
set followed by designing and implementing the General Linear Model (GLM). Finally, the experiment 
obtains the active region of the brain for different actions by using different contrast vectors, which is a 
11-bit vector, on GLM model. In this project, single regressors are used in the second stage in every case.
